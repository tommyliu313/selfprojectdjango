            advertising and communication boards. This allows customers to

        <h2>Q5. What is covered under your insurance policy?</h2>

          <h2>Q7. How does billing work?</h2>
            <p>A7. Billing is automatic so you donâ€™t have to worry about it. After you have placed an order, your card is authorized but not charged. Once your boxes/items have made its way safely to our warehouse for storage, you'll be charged monthly the day after you start storing with us (i.e if your pick-up takes place on the 8th of August, your first payment will be on the 9th of August, and your next payment would take place on the 9th of September). We accept all major credit cards.</p>

          <h2>Q9. Do you prorate refunds?</h2>
            <p>A9. Storage is always charged in monthly increments - there are no prorated charges, weekly rates, or discount(s) for taking your things out of storage early.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4 p-5 bg-info text-white rounded" id="list-item-10">
          <h2>Q10. How do I cancel or terminate my storage plan?</h2>
